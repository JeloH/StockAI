# **Motivation**
This notebook is part of the requierments for my data scientist Udacity degree. In this project I tried to select a data-set that I had no prior knowledge about to be unbiased and challenging.

# **Usage example# **
This notebook shows some steps in analysing huge stocks data obtain from Kaggle. It is always challanging to extract information from many available datapoins, so I tried to adress some major questions in this regards.

# **Requirements# **
The libraries used in this note put are:

* os,
* seaborn,
* pandas,
* numpy,
* matplotlib,
* datetime,
* pandas_datareader
* fix_yahoo_finance

# **Disclaimer:**
This analysis should NOT be taken as financial advice . I have no knowledge of stock trading and good/poor/best terms used to classify companies are based on intuition, which probably is not standard. Needles to say that market complexities cannot be captured by one dimensional price analysis.

# **File structure**
There is a data folder used in this study tyhat contains Stock and ETFs folder and a oil_wti.csv file. Only Stock Folder and oil_wti.csv has been used in this project.
